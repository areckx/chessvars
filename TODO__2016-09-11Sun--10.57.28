Goals and Expectations
----------------------

This is basically an idea that I have been toying with for quite some time.
While studying and playing chess on Linux, or any operating system, there seems
to be a serious lacking in certain areas.


The following features are to be implented in chessvars:


	[] Define scalable grid for play

This aspect should be in all chess clients, in my opinion. There are literally
an infinite amount of numbers to choose from, and it seems that all chess
clients are hardcoded specifically for chess.

The philosophy of chessvars is that a client should be a tool, not a burden,

Let's say you want to invent your own game. The chessvars client will allow you
to start from any number of squares( a relative term. It can be any shape, and
need not conform to a rectangular or square formation)


Now, all it will be my goal to begin with a plugin system. The standard chess
games will be included, such as standard chess, chess960, and the other
variants of standard chess. Shogi, xianqi, and other games of those sort will
be included. The option for grid-style games, as opposed to square, such as Go
will also be included.

This is an ambitious project, but it is a necessary one. People who play one
chess game often play many, and the option to modify the rules is useful in
learning how to visualize and understand the game of chess.


Naturally, there will be a need to notate these games. This will all be
customizable completely by anyone wishing to contribute to or add to an
existing plugin. I am thinking simplicity.

If at all possible, scripts should all be plaintext. If not, then perhaps
lua or some other simple way to define rules.



[] The various fields which will need to be defined


	o board

	o pieces

	o legal moves for each piece

	o notation system

	o clocks / time control

	o scoring systems
